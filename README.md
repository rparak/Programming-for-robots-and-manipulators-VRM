## Description:

The VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators) course enables students to acquire skills and knowledge in programming industrial / mobile robots and manipulators. This course also expands skills with advanced system integration and deployment in real-world robotic applications. The aim of the VRM course is to introduce students to modern approaches to robotic technology with a focus on programming, kinematics / dynamics solutions, motion planning, Industry 4.0 and the use of artificial intelligence (AI).

The main focus is on students practical skills in laboratory exercises, which include several blocks:
1. RobotStudio ABB
2. Forward/Inverse kinematics
3. Robotic operating system (ROS) extended by an industrial package ROS-Industrial (ROS-I)
4. Virtual / digital twin using Unity3D extended by system integration with B&R Automation PLC via OPC UA
5. A simple demonstration of augmented reality based on robotics

These few blocks are extended by theoretical knowledge, which students acquire in the form of lectures.
