## Description:

The VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators) course enables students to acquire skills and knowledge in programming industrial / mobile robots and manipulators. This course also expands skills in advanced system integration and deployment in real-world robotic applications. The aim of the VRM course is to introduce students to modern approaches to robotic technology with a focus on programming, kinematics / dynamics solutions, motion planning, Industry 4.0 and the use of artificial intelligence (AI).

The main focus is on students practical skills in laboratory exercises, which include several blocks:
1. RobotStudio ABB
2. Forward/Inverse kinematics
3. Robotic operating system (ROS) extended by advanced industrial capabilities ROS-Industrial (ROS-I)
4. Virtual / digital twin using Unity3D extended by system integration with B&R Automation PLC via OPC UA
5. A simple demonstration of augmented reality based on robotics

These few blocks are extended by theoretical knowledge, which students acquire in the form of lectures.

## Detailed description of the Syllabus:

**Week 1 (8. 2. 2021):**
- Introduction to the course, main goals, methods and evaluation criteria, etc.
- Introduction to the issue, development and definition of robots, manipulators.
- Introduction of an advanced robotic production line called Industry 4.0 (i4C).

## Assessment Methodology:

**Description:**
- Active participation in laboratory exercises and lectures: 10 points
- Seminar paper: 20 points [[Link](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM/tree/main/Project/1_Seminar_paper)]
- Project no. 1: 30 points [[Link](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM/tree/main/Project/2_Project_1)]
- Project no. 2 (Team project): 40 points [[Link](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM/tree/main/Project/2_Project_2)]

The condition for writing a seminar paper is the use of LaTex (e.g., Overleaf -> Online LaTeX Editor). Projects are submitted via GitHub, which will contain a folder of all relevant files for each project and a short description in English.

The penalty equation for late submission of a project is defined as:

<p align="center">
$\Large p_s = \frac{\Delta t}{24}e^{\frac{1}{2}} - \delta_p,$
</p>

where $\Delta t$ is defined as the difference between the date of deadline and the date of assignment of the project (in hours), and $\delta_p$ is the project error factor defined as $\frac{s_{max}}{10}$.

The maximum possible score is defined as:

<p align="center">
$\Large s = s_{max} - p_s,$
</p>

where $s_{max}$ is the initial maximum score, and $p_s$ is a penalty.

The script for the calculation can be found at [[Link](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM/tree/main/Course_description/project_score_calculator)].
