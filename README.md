## Requirements:

**Software:**
```bash
Robot Operating System (ROS), RoboStudio ABB, Automation Studio B&R, Linux Ubuntu (16.04 or 18.04), Unity3D, Vuforia
```

**Programming Language:**

## Description:

The VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators) course enables students to acquire skills and knowledge in programming industrial / mobile robots and manipulators. This course also expands skills with advanced system integration and deployment in real-world robotic applications.

The main focus is on students' practical skills in laboratory exercises, which include several blocks:
1. RobotStudio ABB
2. Forward/Inverse kinematics
3. Robotic operating system (ROS) extended by an industrial package ROS-Industrial (ROS-I)
4. Virtual / digital twin using Unity3D extended by system integration with B&R Automation PLC via OPC UA
5. A simple demonstration of augmented reality based on robotics
